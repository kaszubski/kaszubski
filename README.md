### What's the craic? ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mat, 

a Senior Software Engineer with a passion for JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Stencil.js/Web Components.

With over 6 years of experience, I've made significant contributions in finance, banking, and e-commerce. Agile environments and crafting sleek project architecturesâ€”that's my turf.

Armed with an Engineering degree and the belief that JavaScript is more than code; it's a lifestyle, I'm fluent in English and Polish, with a bit of German to boot.

Ready to tackle challenges far and wide ðŸ’ª
