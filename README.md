### What's the craic? ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mat, 

a Software Engineer with a knack for JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Web Components. 

Been in the game for over 5 years, leaving a significant mark in finance, banking, and e-commerce. Agile environments and sleek project architecture? That's my turf.

Armed with an Engineering degree and a belief that 'JavaScript is more than code, it's a lifestyle', I'm fluent in English and Polish, with a bit of German to boot. 

Ready to tackle challenges far and wide ðŸ’ª
